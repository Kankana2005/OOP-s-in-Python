object - A "bundle" of related attributes (variables) and methods (function)
ex: phone,cup,book
you need a "class" to create many objects

class = (blueprint) used to design the structure and layout of an object

methods - its with in a function of an object
methods are actions that an object can perform,they define what the object do

class variable : shared among all instances of a class  
                 defined outside the constructor
                 allow you to share data among all objects created from that class

#Inheritance = Allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class
                helps with code reusability and extensibility
               eg: class Child(Parent)  
                    class sub(super) 

#Multiple inheritance = inherit from more than one parent class
                        eg c(A,B)
#Multilever inheritance = inherit from a parent which inherits from another parent      
                        c(B) <- B(A)  <- a

->Abstract class : A class that cannot be instantitated on its own; Meant to be subclassed
                    They can contain abstract methods,which are declared but have no implementation
                    1.Prevents instantitation of the class itself
                    2. Requests children to use inherited abstract methods                                                      


->super() = Fucntion  used in a child  class to call methods from a parent class (superclass)
          Allows you to extend the functinallity of the inherited methods
